# Background
Where did these notes come from? See the README.

# Learning Tips.
  - One term per post-it.
  - I looked up terms everyday, and I practiced recalling terms and explaining them to myself every time I remembered I had these interviews coming up (frequently).
  - I focused on the most difficult topics first before moving onto easier topics.
  - I carried around a notebook and wrote down terms and explanations.
  - Using paper reduces distractions.

# Networking

**Remember: Please Do Not Touch Steve's Pet Alligator ( P- Physical, D -Data , N - Network, T - Transport, S- Session, P- Presentation, A- Application)**  
- OSI Model
  - Application; layer 7 (and basically layers 5 & 6) (includes API, HTTP, etc).
  - Transport; layer 4 (TCP/UDP).
  - Network; layer 3 (Routing).
  - Datalink; layer 2 (Error checking and frame synchronisation).
  - Physical; layer 1 (Bits over fibre).

# Web Application/ Vulnerability Assessment 
- Programming Interfaces
  - Input Validation 
- Security Knowledg Lifecycle
  - Security Design pattern
  - Attack Patterns
- Development Process
  - Security Code Review
  - Application Vulnerability Scanning
- How to test web applications, Networks - and determine/ document deviations from approved  configuration standards and/or policies.
