# Security-Engineering
Security related concepts - Krishan Dev

I am a security engineer and these are the notes for the interviews. My notes consist mostly of a list of terms and technologies to learn, plus little tidbits that helped me remember certain details. At the end are interview tips I made for myself. 

If you are less confident at security topics: I recommend doing a lot of reading and whenever you come across a term you are unfamiliar with or couldn't easily explain, then add it to the list.

# Background
Where did these notes come from? See the README.

# Learning Tips
Track concepts - "To learn", "Revising", "Done"
Any terms I couldn't easily explain went on to post-its.
One term per post-it.
"To learn", "Revising", "Done" was written on my whiteboard and I moved my post-its between these categories, I attended to this every few days.
I looked up terms everyday, and I practiced recalling terms and explaining them to myself every time I remembered I had these interviews coming up (frequently).
I focused on the most difficult topics first before moving onto easier topics.
I carried around a notebook and wrote down terms and explanations.
Using paper reduces distractions.
