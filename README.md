# Security-Engineering
**Security related concepts** - [Krishan Dev] 

I am a security engineer and these are the notes for the interviews. My notes consist mostly of a list of terms and technologies to learn, plus little tidbits that helped me remember certain details. At the end are interview tips I made for myself. 

If you are less confident at security topics: I recommend doing a lot of reading and whenever you come across a term you are unfamiliar with or couldn't easily explain, then add it to the list.

# Background
Where did these notes come from? See the README.

# Learning Tips
- Track concepts - "To learn", "Revising", "Done"
  - Use spaced-repetition.
  - Any terms I couldn't easily explain went on to post-its.
  - One term per post-it.
  - "To learn", "Revising", "Done" was written on my whiteboard and I moved my post-its between these categories, I attended to this every few days
  - I looked up terms everyday, and I practiced recalling terms and explaining them to myself every time I remembered I had these interviews coming up (frequently).
  - I focused on the most difficult topics first before moving onto easier topics.
  - I carried around a notebook and wrote down terms and explanations.
  - Using paper reduces distractions.

- **How to review concepts**

  - Use spaced-repetition.
  - Don't immediately look up the answer, EVEN IF you have never seen the term before. Ask yourself what the term means. Guess the answer. Then look it up.
  - Review terms all the time.
  - You can review items in your head at any time. 
  - If I was struggling to fall asleep, I'd go through terms in my head and explained them to myself. 100% success rate of falling asleep in less than 10 minutes, works every time.
