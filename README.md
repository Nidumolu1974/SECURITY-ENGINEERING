# Security-Engineering
Security related concepts - Krishan Dev

I am a security engineer and these are the notes for the interviews. My notes consist mostly of a list of terms and technologies to learn, plus little tidbits that helped me remember certain details. At the end are interview tips I made for myself. 

If you are less confident at security topics: I recommend doing a lot of reading and whenever you come across a term you are unfamiliar with or couldn't easily explain, then add it to the list.
